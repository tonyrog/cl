Welcome to the Erlang OpenCL binding

To get started you need erlang, preferably R16B.
You also need 'rebar' and a 'C' compiler, i.e.
GCC (or CL.EXE) and a machine with OpenCL installed.

To build: just run rebar compile

To build examples: Goto the examples directory and run make.

Make sure erlang finds the cl/ebin directory.
For example if this file is /home/username/src/cl/README
set ERL_LIBS=/home/username/src/

To build the doc: `rebar get-deps compile doc`

Windows Users:
The scripts look for the OpenCL files in /opt/local/ by default.
You can also use the environment variable OPENCL_DIR to point
another location.

This is an example of howto set up the building env:
I'm assuming you got an mingw environment.

Download a development kit from Nvidia, ATI or Intel:
e.g. http://software.intel.com/en-us/vcsource/tools/opencl-sdk-2013
cp -R /c/Intel SDK/lib /opt/local/
cp -R /c/Intel SDK/include /opt/local/

Example building 64b from CMD:
------------------------------
Setup windows build environment

c:\src\cl> "c:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.1\Bin\SetEnv.cmd"

Setup the paths

c:\src\cl> set PATH="c:\Program Files\erl5.10.1\bin";%PATH%
c:\src\cl> set PATH="c:\tools\git\cmd";%PATH%
c:\src\cl> set OPENCL_DIR="c:\Intel~1\"

And build

c:\src\cl> ..\rebar\rebar.cmd compile

NOTE: OpenCL with ATI drivers for CPU usage don't work when erlang
is started within a mingw shell but does if you start it from
a Windows CMD.exe shell.  (This may depend on the AMD driver version)
